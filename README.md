# mingde
A work in progress desktop environment made with HTML Canvas. Kinda like a combination between my engine [Blackbeard](https://github.com/jetstream0/Blackbeard) and [my fake retro OS webpage](https://prussia.dev/retro). Heavily architecturally inspired by Elm.

Licensed under AGPLv3.

## Some Goals
- [x] Great keyboard-only support (should be usable without a mouse/trackpad, or minimal use of a mouse/trackpad)
- [ ] Minimal rerenders (better performance)
- [ ] Clean and object oriented code
- [x] Reasonable amount of customization
- [ ] Easily extensible by other programmers (+good documentation)
- [x] "Security", or at least windows have limited privileges
- [x] Retro theme
- [x] Cool apps
- [ ] More cool apps
- [x] Terminal with cool stuff
- [ ] With tauri, cool integration with the actual OS

Since I used Canvas, a very long term goal could be writing something to translate the Canvas graphics to Vulkan, so the DE can actually be ran natively. Probably not though, since I don't have any idea on how to do that.
